 1. **Function Definition (`fetchPokemon`)**:
   ```javascript
   function fetchPokemon() {
   ```
  - The script starts by defining a JavaScript function named `fetchPokemon`.
   - Notice the onclick= attribute in the HTML.
   - Clicking the button triggers/executes our "fetchPokemon()"
     function.
   
3. **Getting the Pokémon Name**:
   ```javascript
    let pokemon = $(".pokemon").val();
   ```
   - The .val() method returns the value of whatever the user types
      in the <input class="pokemon"> element.
   - We then store that value in a variable called "pokemon."
   
5. **Creating an XMLHttpRequest Object**:
   ```javascript
    let request = new XMLHttpRequest();
   ```
   - Next, we need to work on our XHR object.
   - We create an XHR object and store it in a variable called
      request.
   - Later, we'll use this variable to fetch data (specifically, a
      "GET" request) from the PokeAPI server.

6. **Constructing the API URL**:
   ```javascript
    let url = `https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/${pokemon}`;
   ```
  - The PokeAPI allows you to search for a pokemon by name if you follow to search for a pokemon by nameHere we create a dynamic url. We retrieve the value entered in the input field and append it to the end of the url. The url will update according to what the user enters into the search field. update based on what  The code creates the URL for the PokeAPI based on the entered Pokémon name. It uses template literals to insert the `pokemon` variable into the URL.

6. **Opening the Request**:
   ```javascript
    request.open("GET", url );
   ```
   The `open` method of the `request` object is used to set up the GET request.
   It specifies the method (GET)
   the URL (constructed earlier)

8. **Handling the Request Response**:
   ```javascript
    request.onload = function() {
   ```
   An event handler is set up to execute the following code when the request's `load` event is triggered (i.e., when the API response is received).

9. **Processing the Response**:
   ```javascript
      if (this.response == 'Not Found') {
        // Handle the case where the Pokémon is not found.
      } else {
        let data = JSON.parse(this.response);
        if (request.status >= 200 && request.status < 400) {
          // Process and display Pokémon data.
        }
      }
   ```
   <!-- ERROR CODE -->
   First, the script checks if the pokemon is not Inside the event handler, the script first checks if the response is "Not Found." If it is, it indicates that the Pokémon was not found, and it updates the placeholders with appropriate error messages.

   If the response is not "Not Found," it proceeds to handle the valid Pokémon data:
   - It parses the response text as JSON and stores it in the `data` variable.
   - It checks if the HTTP status of the response is in the success range (200-399), indicating a successful API request.
   - If the request is successful, it extracts the Pokémon's front image URL and Pokedex ID from the `data` object and updates the placeholders in the HTML with this information.

11. **Sending the Request**:
   ```javascript
    request.send();
   ```
   Finally, the script sends the GET request to the PokeAPI, triggering the request and response flow described above.

The `fetchPokemon` function effectively handles the interaction between the HTML interface, the PokeAPI, and the display of Pokémon information, providing a basic search functionality for the web page. If a Pokémon is found, its details are displayed, and if not, an error message is shown.
